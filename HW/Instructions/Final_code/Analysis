1.   Latitude and temperature are inversely related, meaning that as latitude increases, the temperature decreases, and vice versa.  This relation results in a parabolic or “u-shaped” graph, with the apex (highest temperature) of the curve being at the equator (0 degrees latitude).
2.  As seen in the latitude vs temperature graph, there appears to be more samples/data points for cities located within the northern hemisphere.  This is correlated with the northern hemisphere containing 2x as much land mass as the southern hemisphere.  (Northern hemisphere is 40% landmass and 60% water, while the southern hemisphere is 20% landmass and 80% water)
3. Humidity is measured as relative humidity, which is expressed as a percent.  Relative humidity measures the water vapor in the air, relative to the temperature of the air.  Meaning that warm air can possess more water vapor (moisture) than cold air.  As a result, when given the same amount of absolute/specific humidity, cold air will have a HIGHER relative humidity than warm air.  This is represented in our latitude vs humidity graph where the northern hemisphere appears to be more humid; with a concentration of humidity around a latitude of 60 degrees.  This theory is reinforced by referencing our latitude vs temperature graph, where temperature in the northern hemisphere ranges from ~80 to ~20 degrees below 0, while the temperature of the southern hemisphere ranges from ~80 to ~40 degree. Furthermore, the concentration of humidity at a latitude of 60 is due to the temperature range of that latitude being 0 to 40 degrees.
